# Script: parse_results.pl
# Description: Processes CloudBerry DB test output to extract statistics and results.
#             Analyzes test log files to determine:
#             1. Overall test status (pass/fail)
#             2. Total number of tests run
#             3. Number of passed and failed tests
#             4. Names of failed tests
#             Results are written to a file for shell script processing.
#
# Arguments:
#   log-file    Path to test log file (required)
#
# Input File Format:
#   Expects test log files containing either:
#   - "All X tests passed."
#   - "Y of X tests failed."
#   And failed test entries in format:
#   - "test_name ... FAILED"
#
# Output File (test_results.txt):
#   Environment variable format:
#   STATUS=passed|failed
#   TOTAL_TESTS=<number>
#   FAILED_TESTS=<number>
#   PASSED_TESTS=<number>
#   FAILED_TEST_NAMES=<comma-separated-list>
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Read access to input log file
#   - Write access to current directory
#   - Perl 5.x or higher
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - All tests passed
#   1 - Some tests failed (expected failure)
#   2 - Parse error or cannot access files
#
# Example Usage:
#   ./parse_results.pl test_output.log
#
# Error Handling:
#   - Validates input file existence and readability
#   - Verifies failed test count matches found failures
#   - Reports parsing errors with detailed messages
#
