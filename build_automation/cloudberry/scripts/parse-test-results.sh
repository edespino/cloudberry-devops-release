# Script: parse-test-results.sh
# Description: Parses CloudBerry DB test results and processes the output.
#             Provides GitHub Actions integration and environment variable
#             export functionality. This script is a wrapper around
#             parse_results.pl, adding the following features:
#             1. Default log file path handling
#             2. GitHub Actions output integration
#             3. Environment variable management
#             4. Result file cleanup
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   None
#
# Optional Environment Variables:
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT - GitHub Actions output file path
#   MAKE_NAME    - Used in default log path construction
#
# Arguments:
#   [log-file] - Path to test log file
#                (defaults to build-logs/details/make-${MAKE_NAME}.log)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - parse_results.pl must be in the same directory
#   - Perl must be installed and in PATH
#   - Write access to current directory (for temporary files)
#   - Read access to test log file
#
# Output Variables (in GitHub Actions):
#   status           - Test status (passed/failed)
#   total_tests      - Total number of tests
#   failed_tests     - Number of failed tests
#   passed_tests     - Number of passed tests
#   failed_test_names - Names of failed tests (comma-separated)
#
# Usage Examples:
#   # Parse default log file:
#   ./parse-test-results.sh
#
#   # Parse specific log file:
#   ./parse-test-results.sh path/to/test.log
#
#   # Use with GitHub Actions:
#   export GITHUB_OUTPUT=/path/to/output
#   ./parse-test-results.sh
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - All tests passed successfully
#   1 - Tests failed but results were properly parsed
#   2 - Parse error, missing files, or unknown status
#
# Files Created/Modified:
#   - Temporary: test_results.txt (automatically cleaned up)
#   - If GITHUB_OUTPUT set: Appends results to specified file
#
